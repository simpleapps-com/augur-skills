# Claude Code Documentation

## Entry Points

- **Doc index**: https://code.claude.com/docs/llms.txt — fetch first, find relevant page URL, then fetch that page
- **Full content**: https://code.claude.com/docs/llms-full.txt — large, use when broad context is needed

IMPORTANT: YOU MUST start from `llms.txt` for current URLs. Doc pages are renamed and reorganized with each release — never rely on memorized URLs.
