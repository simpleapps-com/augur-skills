# Fyxer

Fyxer AI records and summarizes meetings. This skill covers extracting data from Fyxer and routing it to other services.

## Fyxer URLs

Recording page: `https://app.fyxer.com/call-recordings/<meeting-uuid>:<calendar-event-id>`

The URL path after `/call-recordings/` contains two parts separated by a colon:
- **Meeting UUID** (before colon): `52f0cf2b-fdb8-4e95-8b01-2afb6d367c69`
- **Calendar event ID** (after colon): `2fg5k3v3hffl91dnuqauc15suk_20260119T190000Z`

Use only the **meeting UUID** for cache folders, duplicate checks, and frontmatter.

Each recording has two tabs:
- **Summary** — AI-generated summary with section headings, participants, action items. Has "Copy summary" and "Download PDF" buttons.
- **Transcript** — Speaker-attributed, timestamped full transcript. Has "Copy transcript" and "Download transcript" buttons.

## Local Cache

All extracted data is cached at `~/.simpleapps/fyxer/<meeting-uuid>/`:

```
summary.txt     - raw Fyxer summary (from Summary tab)
transcript.txt  - raw Fyxer transcript (from Transcript tab)
message.txt     - assembled output (generated by downstream processes, e.g. basecamp.md)
```

Cache is populated via Chrome extraction (see below) and reused across processes.

## Chrome Extraction

Only needed when local cache files are missing.

### Extract transcript

Click the **Transcript** tab. Extraction methods (in order of preference):

1. **"Download transcript" button** (BEST) — Downloads a `.txt` file to `~/Downloads/`. Complete content, no truncation. Copy to cache dir, then delete the download.
2. **"Copy transcript" button** + `pbpaste` — Copies to system clipboard. Write to disk: `pbpaste > transcript.txt`. Reliable but requires clipboard access.
3. **`get_page_text`** — UNRELIABLE. Only captures visible/partial content. Missed most of a 30-minute transcript in testing. DO NOT USE for transcripts.

Save to `~/.simpleapps/fyxer/<meeting-uuid>/transcript.txt`.

### Extract summary

The Summary tab is the default view. Extraction methods (in order of preference):

1. **"Copy summary" button** + `pbpaste` (BEST) — Copies markdown to clipboard. Write to disk: `pbpaste > summary.txt`. Summaries are short (~1,700 chars) so this works well.
2. **`get_page_text`** — Works for short summaries but mixes in page chrome. Not recommended.

Save to `~/.simpleapps/fyxer/<meeting-uuid>/summary.txt`.

### Extract participants

Click the **participant count dropdown** (e.g. "3 participants") in the page header to reveal attendee names and emails. Take a screenshot to read them.

### Clipboard verification

To verify clipboard content is complete before writing to disk:

```javascript
(async () => {
  const text = await navigator.clipboard.readText();
  window.__temp = text;
  return JSON.stringify({
    length: text.length,
    first50: text.substring(0, 50),
    last100: text.substring(text.length - 100)
  });
})()
```

Then write and verify: `pbpaste > target.txt && wc -c target.txt`

**Note**: Do NOT try to read full clipboard content via JS — Chrome MCP truncates JS output at ~1,000 characters. Always use `pbpaste` to write to disk.

### Download cleanup

MUST clean up `~/Downloads/` after copying downloaded files to the cache directory. Fyxer names downloads like `transcript-SA_USCCO.txt`. Repeated downloads append `(1)`, `(2)`, etc.

## Processes

- See `basecamp.md` for posting meeting transcripts as Basecamp Discussions
- See `basecamp-index.md` for the Fyxer Index document (duplicate detection, reconciliation)

## Dependencies

- Chrome browser automation (for extraction when cache is empty)
