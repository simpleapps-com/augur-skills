# Fyxer

Fyxer AI records and summarizes meetings. This skill covers extracting data from Fyxer and routing it to other services.

## Fyxer URLs

Recording page: `https://app.fyxer.com/call-recordings/<fyxer-id>`

Each recording has two tabs:
- **Summary** — AI-generated summary with section headings, participants, action items
- **Transcript** — Speaker-attributed, timestamped full transcript

## Local Cache

All extracted data is cached at `~/.simpleapps/fyxer/<fyxer-id>/`:

```
summary.txt     - raw Fyxer summary (from Summary tab)
transcript.txt  - raw Fyxer transcript (from Transcript tab)
message.txt     - assembled output (generated by downstream processes, e.g. basecamp.md)
```

Cache is populated via Chrome extraction (see below) and reused across processes.

## Chrome Extraction

Only needed when local cache files are missing.

### Extract summary

Navigate to the Fyxer recording URL. The Summary tab is the default view. Extract the full summary text using `get_page_text` and save to `~/.simpleapps/fyxer/<fyxer-id>/summary.txt`.

### Extract transcript

Click the **Transcript** tab. Extraction options (in order of preference):
1. **"Copy transcript" button** — copies to clipboard, then paste into `transcript.txt`
2. **"Download transcript" button** — saves a text file directly
3. **`get_page_text`** — scrape the Transcript tab as a fallback

Save to `~/.simpleapps/fyxer/<fyxer-id>/transcript.txt`.

## Processes

- See `basecamp.md` for posting meeting transcripts as Basecamp Discussions

## Dependencies

- Chrome browser automation (for extraction when cache is empty)
